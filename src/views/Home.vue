					Hopefully, this can replace our old boring website!
					Just remember that there is still a lot of work to be done here. Only the visual part of the website is being completed right now.
					I wanted to get some light feedback from you guys and see what I need to focus on from here.
					<br />
					<br />I still need to work on many features to ensure that this website provides every features that old colossus does.
					But I want this to do much more than colossus, I am thinking of integrating other third party APIs like JIRA and Tantalus so everything you do can be done within this website.

					<br />
					<br />Or if you don't like this and wanna stick to our old website I will be hugely disappointed but that's fine too.
					<br />
					<br />If you have any problem, suggestion or feedback please contact Simong Song on our slack.
